# Ball-Balancing Platform
A dynamic surface controlled by 2 servo motors,
designed to balance a ball on top using a camera. 
The system uses PID control algorithm for stabilize the ball and image processing techniques for precise the ball positioning.
I used a Raspberry Pi, a matrix, and electrolytic capacitors to provide enough electric current.
